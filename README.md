This repository contains a Python program that demonstrates a common error encountered when using recursion: exceeding the maximum recursion depth.  The `factorialBug.py` file showcases the buggy code, which causes a `RecursionError` when calculating the factorial of a large number. The solution, provided in `factorialSolution.py`, addresses this issue by implementing an iterative approach to calculate factorials, effectively avoiding the recursion depth limitation.
